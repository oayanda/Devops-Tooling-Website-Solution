# STEP 1 â€“ PREPARE NFS SERVER

Create an Ec2 instance using RHEL Linux 8 Operating System.

Create 3 volumes and attach them to NFS server instance.

Verify the attached volumes

```bash
lsblk
```

The EBS volumes are attached but not partitioned for use yet. Lets do that using the gdisk utility to perform  a Linux LVM partition.

```bash
sudo gdisk /dev/xvdf
```

Repeat the above step for the remaining two volumes.

Verify the Partiions

```bash
lsblk
```
